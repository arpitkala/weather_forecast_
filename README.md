The Weather Forecast Project is a web application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city around the world. It uses modern web technologies — HTML, CSS, and JavaScript — along with a public Weather API (like OpenWeatherMap) to display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions with an easy-to-use interface.
